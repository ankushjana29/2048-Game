# 2048-Game
A classic, single-player sliding tile puzzle game.The objective is simple: combine numbered tiles on a $4 \times 4$ grid by sliding them in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right). When two tiles of the same value touch, they merge into a single tile equal to their sum. The ultimate goal is to create the 2048 tile.
